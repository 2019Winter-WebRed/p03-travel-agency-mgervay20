        <h3>Located in Queensland, Australia, this tropical getaway is perfect for those who want to relax or explore.</h3>
        
        <!-- Informational description of Whitsunday Islands-->
    <p>The Whitsunday Islands are composed of 74 lush islands on top of a blanket of aquamarine. Surrounded by the Great Barrier Reef, this getaway is a playground for exploration, relaxation, and fun.</p>
    <p>Despite most of the Islands being uninhabited or populated by the Ngaro people, five of these islands have quality resorts.</p>
        
        <!--List of activities to do on the Islands and their descriptions--> 
        <ul>
        <li><b>Sailing</b></li>
            <p>The beautiful teal waters surrounding the Whitsunday Islands are picture perfect. They are relatively warm and calm, which makes them perfect for sailing. Look out for yacht parties or casual sailors, and maybe hitch a ride!</p>
        <li><b>Beach Camping</b></li>
            <p>Select resorts offer beach camping to those who take their adventures seriously. Comfort is always our top priority, so campsites with full facilities are offered on remote islands so you can still have fun without traveling back to the mainland.</p>
        <li><b>Hiking</b></li>
            <p> If you're looking for an excellent hiking spot, look no further than Hamilton Island! With deep winding rainforests and scenic cliffs, you won't want to miss out on the best view of the island, which is at Passage Peak.</p>
        <li><b>Relaxation</b></li>
            <p>The picturesque landscape of the Whitsunday Islands provides a beautiful place to kick back and take a break from life's hectic adventures. Private designated beach spots come with each resort and are accessible to guests only. Many resorts also offer spa packages for your party. This is <i>your</i> vacation.</p>
        <li><b>Fishing</b></li>
            <p>Whether you are staying on the shore or taking a trip to sea, the Whitsunday Islands offer a unique group of catches. From blue and black marlin to 5 different species of tuna, we have it all.</p>
        <li><b>Diving</b></li>
            <p>Being neighbors with the Great Barrier Reef has its perks. The island resorts offer diving programs for all ages and skill levels. The best part: no matter where you stay, you are less than an hour away from an excellent diving spot! Check below for a general diving schedule for the resorts.</p>
